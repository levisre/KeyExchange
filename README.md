#Simple Key Exchange web service#

##Description##

This is a small demo webservice in Ruby using Sinatra Framwork and OpenSSL to create a (not so) secure key exchange between client and server using three methods: RSA, Diffie Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) and Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE).

- With RSA, the scenario is:

	+ Client chooses a random AES key and random Init Vector
	+ Client encrypts `key` and `iv` using pre-defined RSA public key.
	+ Client sends encrypted data to server.
	+ Server receives encrypted data,  then uses private key located on server to decrypt to get `key` and `iv`.
	+ Now both client and server have `key` and `iv`, and use them to encrypt data in each request/response after that.

Pros:

	+ Speed is fast (maybe the fastest)
	+ Very easy to implement

Cons:

	+ Pure AES key and IV are transferred during connection. They're just protected by RSA

- With DHE, the scenario is:

	+ Client creates DH instance, which contains base `G`, modulus `p`, its own private `a` and public `A`
	+ Client sends `G`, `p`, `A` to server.
	+ Server creates DH instance from `G` and `p` sent by client, calculates its own private `b` and public `B`, and calculates Shared secret `s` by using `A` sent by client.
	+ Server sends `B` back to client
	+ Client uses `B` to calculate Shared secret `s`
	+ Both client and server use first 16 bytes of shared secret `s` as AES Key, and the next 16 bytes for AES IV and use them to encrypt data in each request/response after that.`

Pros:

	+ AES Key and IV are not transferred during connection, they're calculated on client and server.

Cons:

	+ Slow speed (when DH Key Size is big, it needs to generate values from the very beginning of key exchange process whenever client make a call to this api, this maybe resolved using static DH params, see `gen_dhparam.rb` to know how to generate DH param in Ruby)
	+ Can't use RSA as an overall layer (in this case, due to the large amount of data being sent)
	+ Bit harder to implement

**NOTE**: To use static DH Parameters, both client and server have to agree to use the same fixed DH param, then modify the code.

File `server.rb`, API `/dhe`, change them to:

```ruby
# file  dhparam.pem is pre-generated and pre-shared on both client and server
serverDH = OpenSSL::PKey::DH.new File.read("dhparam.pem")
```

File ``client.rb`, method `sendDHE`, change them to:

```ruby
# file  dhparam.pem is pre-generated and pre-shared on both client and server
clientDH = OpenSSL::PKey::DH.new File.read("dhparam.pem")
# Must be used to generate public and private keypair before it can be used.
clientDH.generate_key!
# Since base G and modulus p is pre-shared, so they needn't to be sent during key exchange
# Just need to generate new A and a
dhStruct = {
	"A" => clientDH.pub_key.to_s(16)
}

```

- With ECDHE, the scenario is:

	+ Client creates ECDH instance, which generates a keypair `cpub` and `cpriv` using `prime256v1` group
	+ Client sends `cpub` to server
	+ Server creates ECDH instance, which generates a keypair, `spub` and `spriv` using `prime256v1` group
	+ Server computes shared secret `s` by using client' `cpub`
	+ Server sends `spub` to client
	+ Client computes shared secret `s` by using server' `spub`
	+ Both client and server use first 16 bytes of shared secret `s` as AES Key, and the next 16 bytes for AES IV and use them to encrypt data in each request/response after that.`

Pros:

	+ Slightly fast and more secure
	+ AES Key and IV are not transferred during connection, they're calculated on client and server.
	+ Can use RSA as an overall layer to make it more secure (in this case)

Cons:

	+ Bit harder to implement

##How to use##

NOTE: Requires `ruby >= 2.3.0`, as requested by `openssl` gems

Install gems using

```
$ bundle install
```

Execute server:

```
$ ruby server.rb
```

By default, the server is at `http://localhost:4567/`

Test with client:

```
$ ruby client.rb
```
